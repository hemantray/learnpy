Welcome to Statistics and Probability in Data Science using Python!
We are delighted to welcome you to Statistics and Probability in Data Science using Python. 
In this course, you will learn the motivation, intuition, and theory behind the probabilistic 
and statistical foundations of data science, and will get to experiment and practice with these concepts 
via Python programs and the Jupyter Notebook platform.

What do you need to know to succeed?
The course is intended for learners with an undergraduate degree or senior undergraduates 
interested in broadening their understanding of probability and statistics. 
We will assume basic knowledge of the following topics

Logic (e.g., De Morgan’s Laws) 
Set theory (e.g., what are functions)
Calculus (e.g., calculating integrals and derivatives)
Programming (e.g., basic experience with any programming language)
Linear algebra (e.g., vectors and matrices)
The Python programming language will be used throughout the course. 
If you would like to learn or gain more practice with Python, please consider 
viewing or taking the first course in this MicroMasters, Python for Data Science.

Overview
The course will cover the following topics:

Counting and combinatorics
Discrete and continuous probability
Conditional probability and Bayes’ Rule
Random variables
Expectation, variance, and correlation
Common distribution families
Probabilistic inequalities and concentration
Moments and limit theorems
Hypothesis testing
Sampling and confidence intervals
PCA and regression
Entropy and compression
Learning Objectives
The course will teach you how to visualize, understand, and reason about probabilistic 
and statistical concepts, and how to apply your knowledge to analyze data sets and draw 
meaningful conclusions from data. We will cover both theoretical and practical aspects, 
and will start each topic with motivation and intuition and will proceed with rigorous 
arguments and provable techniques. Each topic will be accompanied by a Python Notebook 
that you could run and modify to experiment with the material learned and get a better 
feel for the material covered.
